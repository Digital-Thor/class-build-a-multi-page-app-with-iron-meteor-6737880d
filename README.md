# Build a Multi Page App with Iron Meteor

In this class we'll build a more sophisticated, multi-page application in Meteor. We'll use the iron scaffolding tool to create project structure and boilerplate code. In addition to understanding the concepts of a multi-page app, we'll build several features including multiple users, a comment system, and a customized Meteor Developer Accounts OAuth login.
